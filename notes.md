Position

* I have not created public facing API's
* I have not created apps at google scale.
* I do not perform well in interview problem-solving but excel at "take-home" tests. This evaporates in a collegial environment.
* I have created internal apps at large scale (1M separate logins; 10k users daily)
* I tick all the other boxes:
  * loads of experience across a wide range of problems, languages and frameworks; mostly web
  * motivated and self-directed, with input from business leaders and other stakeholders about goals, strategies, etc. Comfortable sitting in on (participating) in business strategy meetings
  * Experience with AWS & Azure as a developer; not as a devops. Though my last job was trending that way. Prefer the Azure dashboard.
  * I try to be aware of others communication styles and adapt to them. E.g., vocabulary, expository or direct, functional or abstract, cadence. As well, their level of technical knowledge. I have been a teacher and a tutor.
  * Comfortable with diversity, even across large timezones if necessary. Worked with SaudiAramco. Worked with team in ShangHai.
* Very generous benefits. My three pillars of the ideal job in order of importance:
  * Problems: Interesting and challenging problems where I am learning something new and building something useful or valuable.
  * Culture: A culture that is open, collaborative, respectful. Pride in accomplishment yes, but no egos. No hoarding of knowledge. Macro management is necessary. Micromanagement is poison.
  * Fair pay: To be paid in line with the role you have. A little more is nice. A little less is acceptable. (A lot less is possible in special situations: substantial ownership for example.)
* I have not interviewed in quite some time until Sykes was acquired. I can't help but feel I am doing it wrong and that maybe my age is a factor. I have time looking at start-ups.

Concerns
* Business model
  * You are 13th fastest growing company. This is potentially good. You have received (round) funding. This is also good, but it means you have given up equity to do so.
  * What round of funding?
  * What is your particular piece of this business? I have worked in traditional life insurance (thoughts of being an actuary at one time.)
  * Do you plan on an IPO? I assume so, given that yu have investors. If so, what are equity plans for employees? Any? If not, what is the strategy?
  * What are your growth plans?
  * Without naming names, who are your customers? 
  * Is this a viable space? Old, new, transitional? LMS market is relevant here
  * Aside the investors does management or the board have any other interests? Get background of management
  * Mastercard, Toyota, Intuit. Insurance platform

Integrate with other backend services? Insurance data
 Reinsurance?
